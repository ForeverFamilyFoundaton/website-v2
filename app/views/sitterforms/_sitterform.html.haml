  %h2 Certification Program
  %p
    %strong Purpose
  %p In fulfillment of the mission of the Forever Family Foundation, the foundation has embarked on the creation and establishment of a medium certification program/project.  The board of Forever Family Foundation has identified the need for an objective evaluation of those individuals who wish to publicly “validate” their mediumship abilities. In devising such a program, Forever Family Foundation seeks to:
  %ol
    %li Minimize the harm to the general public inflicted by fraudulent, unscrupulous practitioners who exploit their grief and vulnerabilities.
    %li Set a standard which must be met by mediums before they are recognized as having attained a basic level of proficiency in the field so as to be a benefit to the public.
    %li Procure data through scientific, objective observation for use in the Forever Family Foundation supported research endeavors.
  %p
    %strong CONDITIONS AND TERMS OF PARTICIPATION AS A SITTER IN THE PROGRAM:
