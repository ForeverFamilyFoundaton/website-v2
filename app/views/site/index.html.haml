It’s easy to become confused by all the so called “experts” around, as well as various unsubstantiated claims of those calling themselves mediums.  Forever Family Foundation has a process by which mediums seeking certification are vetted and undergo an evaluation of their mediumistic evidence. The process takes place under controlled conditions and only those mediums with exceptional ability gain certification. This valuable resource page will benefit both the bereaved on their journey as well as those seeking guidance on developing their own skills in the area.', icon: 'radio', direction: :right
